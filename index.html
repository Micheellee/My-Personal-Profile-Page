        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          I am born in Munich, Germany and moved to Australia in 2015. I love
          the nature and culture of this beautiful country. No two days are the
          same.
        </p>

        <p>
          I worked in hospitality for seven years when I decided that it is time
          for a career change. When I came across coding I was so facinated how
          easy it is to build your own website that I continued learning and
          soon got my first job as a junior web developer.
        </p>

        <p>
          No day has passed I didn't look for new things to learn and improve my
          skills to become a better developer. This is why I started the
          Techdegree at Team Treehouse. I want to improve my fundamentals and
          manifester the basics before I move on to more advanced coding. I
          choose the techdegree for the great reviews, the perfecly layed out
          track, engaiging videos and great projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of work and study I love to cook and bake, listen to
          audiobooks while I do housework and spend time with my 7 month old
          Mini Lop rabbit, Harry Hopper.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
